ASUS Display Control provides tools for querying and configuring ASUS monitor settings.
This repository currently includes a [CLI](#-cli-quick-start) (Command-Line Interface) tool for scripting and automation, and an AI [Agent Skill](#-ai-agent-skill) for natural-language monitor control.

For users who prefer a GUI (Graphical User Interface), [ASUS DisplayWidget Center](https://www.asus.com/content/monitor-software-osd-displaywidgetcenter/) is available from the official ASUS site.

Use ASUS Display Control CLI for remote IT management and standardized monitor configuration across corporate workstations.

### Typical use cases

- Configure brightness, color presets, input source, power behavior, or OSD-related settings.
- Run startup scripts, scheduled tasks, or enterprise management workflows.
- Audit monitor settings and capabilities for inventory, compliance, or troubleshooting purposes.
- Standardize monitor configurations across new deployments, replacement devices, or entire departments.

### Enterprise Deployment

- For large-scale deployments, ASUS Display Control CLI can be distributed and executed through existing corporate endpoint-management infrastructure, such as Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Configuration Manager (SCCM), PowerShell Remoting, SSH, or similar enterprise management tools.
- Note that ASUS Display Control CLI provides local monitor control on individual workstations only.

## 🚀 CLI Quick Start

### CLI Download

| Platform | Download | Executable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | [dwc_win.zip](https://github.com/ASUS-Display/asus-display-control/raw/main/cli/windows/dwc_win.zip) | `dwc.exe` |
| macOS | [dwc_mac.zip](https://github.com/ASUS-Display/asus-display-control/raw/main/cli/macOS/dwc_mac.zip) | `dwc` |

### CLI Installation

This allows you to run the CLI from any directory without specifying its full path.
The install scripts are included in the unzipped folder.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `install.bat` | `PATH` in Windows Environment Variables |
| macOS | `install.sh` | `PATH` in shell profile |

## 🤖 AI Agent Skill

Use the agent skill when you want an AI assistant to control a monitor for you instead of typing commands manually.

Example requests:

- 💬 "Lower the brightness on monitor 2."
- 💬 "Show me the current input source."
- 💬 "Set all monitors to brightness 50."
- 💬 "Check what settings this monitor supports."

The skill is available at [skills/asus-display-control/SKILL.md](skills/asus-display-control/SKILL.md). Copy or reference it from a compatible agent that supports local skill files or custom Markdown instructions and can run shell commands.

### Compatible Agents

- ✅ Any agent that supports custom Markdown skill files and shell command execution.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Windows 10/11, macOS 12 or later.
- An ASUS monitor with DDC/CI support.
- DDC/CI enabled in the monitor OSD menu.
- A display connection that passes DDC/CI, such as DisplayPort or HDMI.
